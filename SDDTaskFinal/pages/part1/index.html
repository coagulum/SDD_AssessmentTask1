                <h1>Legal Action Resulting from Software Development</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                In the context of software development, users can enforce legal action in situations such as, the infringement of copyright, as well as loss or damage caused by a defect in software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case for copyright infringement, legal action can be taken from a developer that has used copyrighted code without gaining permission or obtaining a licence. In addition, legal action can also be taken if the “look and feel” of an application was copied. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case for defects in software, developers to an extent can be liable bugs, errors, security vulnerabilities, or other defects in the software. However, most developers enforce licence agreements that states that they are not liable for negligence, or for any defects in the software whatsoever.For more information visit: <a href="https://www.dundaslawyers.com.au/are-software-developers-liable-for-defects-in-their-software/">Dundas Lawyers website.</a>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    As a result, the issue would result in going to court and the perpetrator may face imprisonment, fines, and remove the application for commercial use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, it is important for legal action to be in place as without it, perpetrators are left able to profit off stolen intellectual property, as well as continue creating diservice to users and clients of the software with the misuse of data.

                <h1>Case Study - Nintendo and the Lawsuit Against ROM Website</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Back on the 19th of September, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against the website RomUniverse, arguing that the owner Matthew Storman uploaded and distributed pirated Nintendo games, and profited from mass-scale copyright infringement by charging paid subscriptions.                
                </p>
                <img src="indexImages/mario.png" alt="mario">
                <p>
                    In the lawsuit, the court sided with Nintendo for sufficient evidence in copyright infringement.This includes Storman’s denials which failed to convince the court as he admitted to uploading content to the site in a previous deposition 
               </p>
               <p>
                   Furthermore, Nintendo also argued on how Storman was profitting from the infringements of users by charging for premium access to the site. In fact, in the Storman testified that, during 2019, the site generated between $30,000-36,000 in revenue. Thus, Nintendo initially requested 15 million US dollars for infringements, but was reduced due to Judge Marshall Judge Marshall believing that the fine should be $35,000 worth of statutory damages for each of the 49 copyrighted works.
               </p>
                <p>
                    This lawsuit was successful and won Nintendo around 2.1 million US dollars in damages. However, it was unsuccessful in removing the website as it “ failed to show that it had suffered ‘irreparable harm’ from ROMUniverse’s actions, and because the site had already been shut down there was no threat of further infringements.” (Scullion, 2022). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this case study, the lawsuit demonstrates the legal actions that can take place from software.
